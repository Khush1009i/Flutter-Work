# Flutter & Dart Projects

## About Flutter
Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google. It is used to build cross-platform applications from a single codebase, targeting Android, iOS, web, desktop, and more. Flutter provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets, high performance rendering, and great developer productivity with features like hot reload.

## About Dart

It is the language behind Flutter and is designed for both frontend (UI) and backend (server-side) development. Dart is object-oriented, has a clean syntax, and supports asynchronous programming with `async` and `await`.
